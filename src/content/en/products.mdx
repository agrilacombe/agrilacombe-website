## Our Farm Products

At Agri Lacombe, we take pride in offering two main specialty crops, cultivated with a deep commitment to quality and sustainability.

### Fresh Quebec Asparagus

Our asparagus is the jewel of our farm, grown on the majority of our land. We select varieties renowned for their tenderness, delicate flavor, and perfect adaptation to our Quebec climate. Each spear is harvested by hand at the peak of freshness, guaranteeing an incomparable taste experience. From classic green to hints of purple, our asparagus is perfect for a wide range of culinary delights.

### Sweet & Savory Spanish Onions

Our Spanish onions are cultivated for their generous size, mild and slightly sweet flavor, and crisp texture. Perfect raw in salads, caramelized to accompany your dishes, or as an aromatic base for a multitude of recipes, they are a staple in any kitchen. We ensure they are grown and cured to perfection for optimal flavor and storage.
